A subset of 25 randomly selected values was choosen from from a population of 768 values. 
The random sample has a mean of 116.64 and max of 183. The population has a mean of 120.89 and max of 199. 
The 98th percentile of the BMI of the random sample is 40.248 and the population is 47.526. 
The values of both sets are fairly close to each other, although the 98th percentile measurement 
is slightly higher for the random sample. A bootstrapped sample of 500 samples using 150 values from the 
population was created and was used to estimate blood pressure. The mean of the sample is approximately 
69.18, standard deviation 19.20, and the 98th percentile is 100. The mean of the population is approximately 
69.11, standard deviation 19.36, and the 98th percentile is 99.32. The values of the bootstrapped sample 
and the population are fairly close to each other, and although the 98th percentile is slightly higher for
the bootstrapped sample, in general the values are closer to each other than the subset of 25 values.
